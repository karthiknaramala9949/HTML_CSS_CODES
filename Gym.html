                <h3>STRENGTH TRAINING</h3>
                <img src="STRENGTH-TRAINING.png">
                <P>Streng training involves exercises designed to increase your muscle strength and mass. 
                    This type of workout is crucial for overall functional fitness promoting muscle maintenance as you age. 
                    Traditional strength training often involves lifting weights or using resistance machines at the gym. 
                    Bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats and planks are also effective for building strength. 
                    Incorporating these various types of strength training into your fitness routine can increase your metabolic rate and improve your overall health.

                <h3>BALANCE TRAINING</h3>
                <img src="FLEXIBILITY-AND-BALANCE.png">
                <P>These types of workouts focus on enhancing your range of motion and stability. 
                    These workouts play a vital role in preventing injuries and improving your overall performance in other exercises. 
                    Yoga and Pilates are excellent examples of flexibility and balance workouts. These activities emphasize stretching, controlled movements and body awareness, helping you achieve a strong and flexible physique.

                <h3>HIGH-INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING (HIIT)</h3>
                <img src="HIGH-INTENSITY-INTERVAL-TRAINING-HIIT.png">
                <P>For those with a busy schedule, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a game-changer. 
                    HIIT exercises involve short bursts of intense movements followed by brief periods of rest or low-intensity activity. 
                    This approach not only saves time but also boosts your metabolism, helping you burn calories even after your workout is done. 
                    Exercises like burpees, sprints and kettlebell swings are often included in HIIT routines.
                </P>

                <h3>CIRCUIT TRAINING</h3>
                <img src="CIRCUIT-TRAINING.png">
                <P>Circuit training involves performing a series of exercises in a specific sequence, with minimal rest in between. 
                    This type of workout targets different muscle groups and can be easily customized to your fitness level. 
                    It’s a versatile option that can be adapted for strength, cardio or a mix of both. Circuit training keeps your heart rate up and offers an efficient way to work on various fitness components in a single session.
